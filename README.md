1) Connect a secondary camera or webcam to the user's computer, which already has its own built-in camera.

2) The second camera should be positioned on either the left or right side of the user.

3) Download the "main_code" folder to the user's computer.

4) Verify whether the system being used by the user meets the specified requirements. In certain situations, the user may need to either upgrade or downgrade the system in order to align with the requirements.
